### From Hopper to Analysis: The True Quality of Your Olives, Instantly.

Every truckload arriving at your mill holds a promise. Within that mix of olives lies the potential of your future Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Until now, assessing this potential with complete objectivity has been a complex task reliant on experience.

Ceresia Vision changes the game with **Ceres**, our computer vision system. With a simple photograph of the batch in the hopper, our Artificial Intelligence analyzes every olive. In seconds, it provides a precise report on the factors that truly matter: the ripeness state to estimate **oil yield**, and the detection of key defects like **olive fly damage** or **ground-picked olives**.

With this data in hand, you can make decisions that change everything: optimize blends to maximize yield, perform fair and transparent settlements with your growers, and separate lower-quality batches to protect the excellence of your high-end EVOO.

Ceres is more than technology; it's the tool to ensure maximum quality from the very first moment. Welcome to the olive mill of the future.
