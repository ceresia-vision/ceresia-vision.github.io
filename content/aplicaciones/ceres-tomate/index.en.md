## Maximum Quality for Your Tomatoes, Defined at Reception.

Consistency is key in the tomato industry. The quality of your final product—whether for the fresh market, paste, or canned goods—depends directly on the raw material that enters your plant. Quickly and objectively evaluating tons of tomatoes on the reception line is the first major challenge.

With **Ceres**, our computer vision solution, that challenge becomes your greatest competitive advantage. Using a camera over the unloading line, we analyze the flow of tomatoes in real-time. In seconds, our Artificial Intelligence delivers a detailed report on:

* **Color and Ripeness:** Precise and consistent classification of the ripeness stage to ensure the consistency and color of your final product.
* **Defect Detection:** Automatic identification of tomatoes with cracks, sun scald, rot, or mechanical damage that affect quality.
* **Presence of Foreign Materials:** Detection of leaves, stems, soil, and other materials to protect your machinery and the purity of the batch.

This objective data allows you to instantly classify raw materials, adjust the parameters of your processing line, and value batches based on measurable and transparent quality. Ensure a superior production standard and optimize your yield.

Ceres is the essential tool for the agri-food industry of the future.
