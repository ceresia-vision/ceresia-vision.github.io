## The True Quality of Your Grapes, Revealed Instantly.

The moment of harvest is critical. Every trailer that arrives at your winery holds all the work of a year in the vineyard and the potential of your future wines. Ensuring quality at this point is fundamental for successful winemaking.

Introducing **Ceres**, the computer vision system that provides a complete X-ray of your grapes in seconds. With a simple photograph at the hopper or sorting table, our Artificial Intelligence analyzes the batch and provides you with objective data on:

* **Health Index:** Precise detection and quantification of *botrytis*, mildew, or other molds that could compromise the quality of the must.
* **Foreign Materials:** Automatic identification of leaves, stem fragments, insects, or any unwanted element that could introduce off-flavors.
* **Harvest Quality:** Evaluation of the berry's integrity to prevent premature oxidation and decide on the appropriate processing method.

With this information, the winemaker can make crucial decisions on the spot: routing batches to different vinification lines, adjusting crushing or pressing processes, and valuing the grapes from their growers with complete transparency.

Ceres is the definitive tool to protect the expression of your *terroir* from the very first minute. Welcome to precision winemaking.
