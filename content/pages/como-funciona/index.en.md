Ceres is our computer vision analysis system that brings objectivity and precision to the classification of your fruit.

Using high-resolution cameras, it captures images in your hoppers or sorting belts and instantly analyzes them with **Artificial Intelligence**. Our exhaustively trained model classifies each fruit to determine its health and ripeness. In seconds, you get a detailed report to make data-driven decisions.

The system is **fully modular**: start with the essentials and expand as your needs grow.

# Central Processing Base

This is the core of Ceres. It is a powerful industrial computer that runs our Artificial Intelligence algorithms at maximum speed to ensure fast and reliable results.

From its intuitive control screen, your operators can manage the entire system, initiate analyses, and consult detailed reports without complications. It is the unified command center for quality control.

# Standard Cameras

Our **Standard Cameras** are the ideal solution for fixed analysis points, such as the main reception hopper.

They are installed in a strategic location and are operated directly from the screen of the Central Processing Base. With a single click, the operator captures the image and instantly gets the quality analysis. They are robust cameras, designed for industrial environments and optimized to ensure maximum precision.

# Interactive Cameras

The **Interactive Cameras** bring maximum flexibility to your operation. Designed for multiple or remote analysis points, they allow operators to control the system from a tablet or mobile phone.

Directly from the work area, an operator can view the camera feed, capture the image, and receive the analysis on their own device. This autonomy streamlines work and allows for quality control checks at any point in your facility with total efficiency.
